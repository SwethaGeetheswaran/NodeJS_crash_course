# NodeJS-Basics

Learning Node.js basics using Brad Traversy courses.

NODE.JS

- Javascript run time 
- highly scalable
- Event driven
- Non-blocking I/O model => asynchronous , triggers an event (unlike PHP)
- used with front end framework 
- Used for REST API’s and micro services
- CRUD operations

Node package Manager (NPM)
- install libraries, frameworks
- creates a node_module folder
- package.json has all dependencies


npm init => generates package.json file
npm install express => installs locally
npm install -g express => installs globally


NODE MODULES:
- files that have an export
- Can embed files into another
- Can add files using “require()” 

-D => to install DEV dependency
NODEMON => dependency to avoid reloading the server

node filename => to run a node file
